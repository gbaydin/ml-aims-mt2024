# Machine Learning
**AIMS CDT - Michaelmas Term 2024, Week 4**

This repository contains material related to the practical sessions and assessment of the Machine Learning module within the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems (AIMS)](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/) CDT taught course at the University of Oxford.

For more information please visit the [course web page](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gunes/teaching/ml-aims-mt2024.html).

## Practical sessions

These are hands-on tutorial sessions that are grouped into four parts reflecting the structure of the module covering eight lectures over four days. See under each practical directory for more information.

- L1-L2: linear regression
- L3-L4: differentiable programming
- L5-L6: image classification
- L7-L8: probabilistic programming

#### Setup
In order to follow the practicals you need to have the following installed.

- A Python runtime. [Anaconda with Python 3.8](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is highly recommended.
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -- These are standard modules included in Anaconda by default.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/) -- These can be installed by following instructions in their websites.

Alternatively you can use a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook, within which PyTorch and the other dependencies are available by default and you can install Pyro by running `!pip install pyro-ppl` in a regular code cell. Colab notebooks run the code in the cloud and do not require any installation in your local machine.

#### Demonstrators
The demonstrators for the practicals are [Vít Růžička](https://previtus.github.io/) and [Zeynep Duygu Tekler](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/zeynep-duygu-tekler/).

## Assessed assignment

The course is assessed by a take-home assignment that needs to be submitted. See the assessed assignment directory for the instructions. **Deadline: 11 November 2024**
